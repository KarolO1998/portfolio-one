# portfolio-one
###### This is the first rough draft of a portfolio site. Later on I wish to make it better and have it more reactive. The basics of this portfolio page include but are not limited too, working navigation link where the UI scrolls to each section, having a responsive layout, and when the portfolio page loads it is presented with the developers name, a recent photography and how to contact them.
